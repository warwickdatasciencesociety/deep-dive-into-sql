## Is there a certificate for this course?
If you are taking this course through WDSS and want to receive the certificate, you should submit all homework scripts with your solutions to [sean.koh@warwick.ac.uk](mailto:sean.koh@warwick.ac.uk). They will assess your progress and based on that you will be issued the certificate. It is therefore important to **save all your homework scripts** as evidence of completing the course. **Note**: the solutions to the homework exercises are also available on the course website but you are encouraged not to look into those and tackle the questions by yourself.

If you are taking this course independently but still wish to receive the certificate, reach out to [Osandi Payagala]) (course coordinator)

## When and how should I submit the homework?
The homework scripts should be submitted directly to [sean.koh@warwick.ac.uk](mailto:sean.koh@warwick.ac.uk). You can submit all your scripts in one batch at the end of the course or send them to your mentor regularly as the course progresses.

## I take the course through WDSS. Do I need to attend the live teaching events?
Live teaching events are not compulsory. If you are not able or opt not to attend our live teaching events, then you may follow the course content at your own pace - all of the recordings and materials are available through the website. However, we strongly recommend that you attend the live events as it gives you the chance to clarify any doubts as soon as they arise and they keep you engaged with the course.
